data-512-project-common-analysis
================================
This repository contains the Common analysis for DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science course project component at the University of Washington - Masters in Data Science program

Date of Code Run: 2022-11-3

Goal: Course Project
==============================

We have all been affected by a worldwide pandemic for the past three years. This has had a terrible and disruptive impact on many nations and has had a significant negative personal impact on many people and their families. The datafication of the pandemic is one feature that has been difficult to ignore during the past three years.

data-512-project-common-analysis project is an analysis exercise with primary goal to understand the general biases in the models that originate from the bias in the input data used for training the model. This collaborative analysis gives a good clarity on how the masking policy is impacting the progression of the COVID virus among various counties in USA. It helps us understand the reasons, impact and other important factors that directly or indirectly impacted the COVID infection spread.

Count Assigned: Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States

Datasource Information
----------------------
The data for this project is extracted has different aspects and way of collection. One source is CDC for county specific information, other John Hopkins with confirmed cases data shared on Kaggle and other is New York Times Survey data.

Dataset Sources
The RAW_us_confirmed_cases.csv file from the Kaggle repository of John Hopkins University COVID-19 data. This data is updated daily and recent version is used
The CDC dataset of masking mandates by county. Note that the CDC stopped collecting this policy information in September 2021.
The New York Times mask compliance survey data.

Issues and Special Considerations
---------------------------------

1.  There are few data gaps in the confirmed cases data. To bypass through these gaps, rolling averages are used on confirmed cases data. This will eliminate any noise that arises in the data due to data collection issues

2.  For milwaukee county, the mask usage survey was conducted before the masking mandate was in place. Hence, these % values shouldn't be taken at face value when inferring the impact of masking on the infection spread
