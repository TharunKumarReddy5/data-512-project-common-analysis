data-512-project-common-analysis
================================
This repository contains the Common analysis for DATA 512 Human Centered Data Science course project component at the University of Washington - Masters in Data Science program

Date of Code Run: 2022-11-3

Goal: Course Project
==============================

We have all been affected by a worldwide pandemic for the past three years. This has had a terrible and disruptive impact on many nations and has had a significant negative personal impact on many people and their families. The datafication of the pandemic is one feature that has been difficult to ignore during the past three years.

data-512-project-common-analysis project is an analysis exercise with primary goal to understand the general biases in the models that originate from the bias in the input data used for training the model. This collaborative analysis gives a good clarity on how the masking policy is impacting the progression of the COVID virus among various counties in USA. It helps us understand the reasons, impact and other important factors that directly or indirectly impacted the COVID infection spread.

County Assigned: Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, United States

Datasource Information
----------------------
The data for this project is extracted has different aspects and way of collection. One source is CDC for county specific information, other John Hopkins with confirmed cases data shared on Kaggle and other is New York Times Survey data.

Dataset Sources
The RAW_us_confirmed_cases.csv file from the Kaggle repository of John Hopkins University COVID-19 data. This data is updated daily and recent version is used for analysis
The CDC dataset of masking mandates by county. Note that the CDC stopped collecting this policy information in September 2021.
The New York Times mask compliance survey data.

Issues and Special Considerations
---------------------------------

1.  There are few data gaps in the confirmed cases data. To bypass through these gaps, rolling averages are used on confirmed cases data. This will eliminate any noise that arises in the data due to data collection issues

2.  For milwaukee county, the mask usage survey was conducted before the masking mandate was in place. Hence, these % values shouldn't be taken at face value when inferring the impact of masking on the infection spread

Input Data Files
----------------

-   RAW_us_confirmed_cases.csv - Consists of daily confirmed COVID cases for all counties in USA

-   RAW_us_deaths.csv - Consists of daily fatality count due to COVID for all counties in USA
    
-   mask-mandate-milwaukee.csv - Mask mandate information for the Milwaukee county

-   mask-use-by-county.csv - Survey that contains the percent values of mask compliance based on level of compliance

Output Files
-----------------

### Screenshots

Examples of output plots generated by the functions. Also mentioned the inference drawn from various metrics calculated using the provided COVID data for milwaukee county. These metrics were compared against the masking mandate policy implemented. Below are few of the findings.

-   **Screenshot of plot 1:**  Incidence Rate or Positive Per capita Plot

The first graph contains the positive cases per capita rate and it's progression with respect to masking policy changes

**Inference:**
We can observe that after the before the mask mandate is enforced, the spread category is uncontrolled (red band) indicating the necessity for a mask mandate. Post the mask mandate is implemented, we can notice that the phase shifted into a controlled band (orange) and stayed for 60 time intervals (2 months). The same trend can be observed before the masking mandate end. However, the impact of removing the mandate can be seen in the next 30 time intervals (1 month). This shows a clear impact of masking on the positive cases per capita in milwaukee.

-   **Screenshot of plot 2:**  Growth Factor Plot

The second graph contains the growth factor and it's progression with respect to masking policy changes

![Alt text](https://github.com/TharunKumarReddy5/data-512-project-common-analysis/blob/main/plots/growth_factor.png)

**Inference:**
The growth factor plot shows a clear indication of how the GF values have died down after the mask mandate started and the impact lasted for almost 2 months before it spiked again during the next wave of COVID. High growth factor values are again observed after the mask mandate was relaxed in April 2021.

-   **Screenshot of plot 3:**  Transmission Rate Plot

The third graph contains the virus transmission rate and it's progression with respect to masking policy changes

![Alt text](https://github.com/TharunKumarReddy5/data-512-project-common-analysis/blob/main/plots/transmission_rate.png)

**Inference:**
In the plot, we can observe that transmission rate has gone down after the masking mandate has started. This also indicates how the spread of the virus has gone down after people following the mandate. However, the transmission rate peaked immediately after the mandate is removed but came down after a month. This can be because of the vaccination phase that started and implementing second doses to mass population.

-   **Screenshot of plot 4:**  Infection Rate Plot (with changepoints)

The fourth graph contains the infection rate and it's progression with respect to masking policy changes

[Image4](https://github.com/TharunKumarReddy5/data-512-project-common-analysis/blob/main/plots/infection_rate.png)

![Alt text](https://github.com/TharunKumarReddy5/data-512-project-common-analysis/blob/main/plots/infection_rate.png)

**Inference:**
From the 4th change point, we can observe that how the masking mandate brought down the infection rate. This change shows an evidence of the impact of masking policy. From the 8th change point to 9th, there is no huge difference in infection rates. Hence, removing masking policy can be attributed to the stability. However, at the final change point (10th) the COVID infection rate started to peak.

-   **Screenshot of plot 5:**  Derivative of Infection Rate (with changepoints):

The fifth graph contains the derivate of infection rate and it's progression with respect to masking policy changes

[Image5](https://github.com/TharunKumarReddy5/data-512-project-common-analysis/blob/main/plots/derivative_infection_rate.png)

![Alt text](https://github.com/TharunKumarReddy5/data-512-project-common-analysis/blob/main/plots/derivative_infection_rate.png)

**Inference:**
We can observe that the after 4th change point after the masking mandate started, the derivate is more closer to 0 indicating the change in infection rate over time is not frequent. The same pattern can be observed after removing the mandate but oscillated more at the end.

Overall, it is evident from the above analysis as to why there arose a necessity for enforcing and removing masking policy. The analysis clearly shows an impact of masking on infection rate and how it accelerated after the mandate is removed. However, there are few exceptions where observed, where we see peak infection rates even after the masking policy is in place. This can be attributed to high impact of other aspects like vaccinations, recovery rates, hospitalizations
